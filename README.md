## General
MXMCPy is an open source package that implements many existing multi-model 
Monte Carlo methods (MLMC, MFMC, ACV) for estimating statistics from expensive,
high-fidelity models by leveraging faster, low-fidelity models for speedup.

## Getting Started

### Installation

MXMCPy can be easily installed using pip:
```shell
pip install mxmcpy
```

Alternatively, the MXMCPy repository can be cloned:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nasa/mxmcpy.git
```
and the dependencies can be installed manually as follows. 

### Dependencies
MXMCPy is intended for use with Python 3.x.  MXMCPy requires installation of a 
few dependencies which are relatively common for optimization/numerical methods
with Python:
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - h5py
  - pytorch
  - pytest, pytest-mock (if the testing suite is to be run)
  
A `requirements.txt` file is included for easy installation of dependencies with 
`pip` or `conda`.

Installation with pip:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Installation with conda:
```shell
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

### Documentation
See the [MXMCPy Read the Docs page](https://mxmcpy.readthedocs.io/).

## Running Tests
An extensive unit test suite is included with MXMCPy to help ensure proper 
installation. The tests can be run using pytest on the tests directory, e.g., 
by running:
```shell
python -m pytest tests 
```
from the root directory of the repository.

## Example Usage

The following code snippet shows the determination of an optimal sample
allocation for three models with assumed costs and covariance matrix using
the MFMC algorithm:

```python
import numpy as np
from mxmc import Optimizer

model_costs = np.array([1.0, 0.05, 0.001])
covariance_matrix = np.array([[11.531, 11.523, 12.304],
                              [11.523, 11.518, 12.350],
                              [12.304, 12.350, 14.333]])
                             
optimizer = Optimizer(model_costs, covariance_matrix)
opt_result = optimizer.optimize(algorithm="mfmc", target_cost=1000)

print("Optimal variance: ", opt_result.variance)
print("# samples per model: ", opt_result.allocation.get_number_of_samples_per_model())
```

For more detailed examples using MXMCPy including end-to-end construction of
estimators, see the scripts in the [examples directory](examples/) or the 
[end-to-end example](https://mxmcpy.readthedocs.io/en/main/ishigami_example.html)
in the documentation.
